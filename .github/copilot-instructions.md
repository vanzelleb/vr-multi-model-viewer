Verify that every button has a unique ID and that the IDs are used in the JavaScript code to add event listeners.

Follow best practices for UI/UX design, including accessibility considerations.

Ensure that the JavaScript code is modular and follows best practices for organization and readability.

Do not use any external libraries or frameworks for the JavaScript code or CSS styles. All code should be written in plain JavaScript and CSS.

Make the code responsive and ensure it works well on different screen sizes. 

Always import functions directly between modules instead of relying on global variables or window properties.

Refactor when files become too large or complex. Aim for a maximum of 200 lines of code per file, including comments and whitespace.
